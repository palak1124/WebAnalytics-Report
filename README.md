# WebAnalytics-Report
Introduction
This project is a Website Analytics Dashboard created using Power BI. It provides a clear and interactive view of key website performance metrics such as total page views, bounce rate, total sessions, and average session duration. The dashboard helps users drill down into device type, browser type, and traffic sources to get deeper insights into user behavior.

Project Details
The dashboard is divided into two main pages:

Overall Website Analytics:
It displays a summary of total page views (8.37M), average bounce rate (34.3%), total sessions (500K), and average session duration (1:12 minutes). It highlights the target achieved (+9%) and breaks down sessions into converted (68%) and not converted (32%). It also provides page views distribution by device type (mobile, desktop, tablet) and browser type (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Opera, Safari).

Drillthrough View (Mobile Device Focus):
Upon drilling through to the mobile device type, it shows specific metrics for mobile users â€” total page views (4.63M), total sessions (278K), and a slightly lower average session duration (1:11 minutes). Monthly trends and page views by weekday are also visualized, showing a steady engagement across all days.

Key Features:

Target vs actual comparison

Device-wise and browser-wise performance analysis

Drillthrough capability for deep dives

Time-series and weekday distribution visualization

My Learnings
While creating this dashboard, I learned:

How to design clean, easy-to-understand KPI cards in Power BI

Implementation of Drillthrough functionality to provide focused analysis

Using dynamic visualizations like time-series graphs and bar charts to show trends clearly

How to compare performance against targets and highlight differences effectively

Structuring a dashboard layout to guide the user journey from overview to detailed insights

Conclusion
This project helped me strengthen my skills in Power BI dashboard development, data storytelling, and drillthrough analysis. I understood the importance of user-friendly design and how breaking down data into smaller segments (like device type or browser) can uncover hidden insights. This dashboard serves as a powerful tool for tracking website performance and can be easily customized for any website analytics requirement.
